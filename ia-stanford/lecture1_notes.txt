What is an AI ? --> What an AI can do for you ?

Applications of AI
==================

Computer and AI = Tops and downs since 1956
Characteristics of AI tasks = High societal impact + diversity + complexity

FEW topic where AI has already an impact on society:
-Handwriting recognition - 1983-?
-Machine translation - 1960s-?
-Virtual assistants - Speech recognition and natural language understanding - 2010-?
-Autonomous driving - 1980s-?

Human Vs Machines
-1997: Deep Blue
-2011: IBM Watson
-2016: AlphaGo

Challenges
===========

Complexity = Computational (Time/Memory) + Information (Data)

Paradigm
========

How to solve real life problem with AI ?
Separate what to compute (modeling) from how to compute it (algorithm).
AI algorithms ranks from "low-level intelligence" to "high-level intelligence".

Machine learning
=================

Key idea:
Machine learning allows to shift the complexity from the program to the data.
Learning algorithm maximizes accuracy on training examples.
Generalization is a leap of faith at the heart of machine learning algoritm : 
the trained program will produce good results beyond the set of training examples.

Low-level intelligence to high level intelligence models

*reflex models (model) - linear classifiers (algorithm)
Key idea: linear classifiers f(x) = sign( sum_i w_i phi_i(x) ) (features + weights)

*state-based (model) - minimum cost paths through graphs
Key idea: a state captures all the relevant information about the past in order to act optimally in the future
Search problems, markov decision processes, adversarial games

*variable-based (model)
Key idea: a solution corresponds to an assignment of values to variables
Constraint satisfaction problem : Hard constraints (Scheduling)
Bayesian networks

*logic 
Key idea: logic provices a compact language for modeling which gives us more expressivity.
Natural language parsin, knowledge representation, logical inference

A key challenge is to combine the modeling richness of logic with the robustness and agility of machine learning
