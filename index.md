I graduated my PhD at INRIA Rhone-Alpes on 3rd of October 2016. During my PhD, I studied the [simulation and control of physical phenomena](/pages/thesis.html) for graphics under the supervision of [Fran√ßois Faure](https://team.inria.fr/imagine/francois-faure) and [Marie-Paule Cani](https://team.inria.fr/imagine/marie-paule-cani).
